# What are Open Source Projects?

Open source projects are software initiatives where the source code is made publicly available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. These projects encourage collaboration and transparency, allowing developers from around the world to contribute to the codebase, improve functionality, and fix bugs.

Some well-known open source projects include the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the Mozilla Firefox web browser. These projects have thriving communities that support and maintain the software, ensuring its continued development and improvement.

Similarly, GraphScript is an open source project that aims to provide a visual scripting engine and flow-based programming IDE. It is developed under the organization [`GraphScript-Labs`](https://github.com/GraphScript-Labs).
